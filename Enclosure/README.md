# Switchberry 3D Printed Case Instructions

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/771367be-c267-423d-81b1-344859a21cba)

The Switchberry 3D case is designed to be printed in two parts: a top cover and bottom plate. The bottom has two holes for heatsinks / airflow, and the top is ventilated in case you'd like to add on a fan, attached to the small JST SH (1mm) fan header on the Switchberry.

The 3D printable STL files are available in this directory:

  - [Switchberry_Case_v5_Top.stl](Switchberry_Case_v5_Top.stl)
  - [Switchberry_Case_v5_Bottom.stl](Switchberry_Case_v5_Top.stl)

It is recommended you print the top out of a material which can take some heat without deforming. The Switchberry shouldn't get *too* hot, but using PETG or ASA is a better option than PLA.

## Needed parts

The links below go to Amazon, but you can buy these parts from wherever you'd like:

  - [4x M3x10 (+6mm) Male to Female Brass Threaded Spacers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BLSRZYJ) (to provide adequate space between the top cover and the PCB)
  - [4x M3x12 SHCS Screws](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FGV5FCBN) (to attach the bottom to the top)
  - [4x round rubber feet](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GLJB3Z4) (to hold Switchberry stably on a desk or shelf, and provide convective airflow under the board)

  1. Print the top and bottom case on a 3D printer (no supports required). I printed mine in ASA/PLA, but any material should be okay, depending on your environmental conditions and printer capabilities.
  3. Screw the M3x10 threaded spacers into the standoffs in the top case; this will require some force, so it is recommended you use a nut driver instead of trying to thread them in by hand.
  3. (Optionally, if using M.2 GPS module) Install GPS module into Switchberry, and plug in GPS U.FL to SMA female cable. Insert female SMA end into the hole in the top case and secure with included nut.
  4. Place the Switchberry board into the top case, Ethernet port side first, and ensure everything is aligned properly.
  5. Place the bottom cover over the Switchberry board, being careful to start with the post between the Ethernet ports (it will need to seat into the recess in the top cover), then make the rest of the case flush with the top cover.
  6. Screw four M3x12 SHCS screws into the four screw holes in the bottom cover. These can be a tight fit, depending on the accuracy of your 3D print.
  7. Place four adhesive rubber feet over the four circular foot pads on the bottom cover.
